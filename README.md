# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This project is an analysis of Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 volunteers (subjects) performing
activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

run_analysis.R – This R script merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, and then extracts only the measurements on
the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. After that, it calculates average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Data – Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0. This data should be downloaded from the link below and extracted directly into the data directory used for this project. https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

CodeBook.md – Describe all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
